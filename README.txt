We learned a lot during this project! 

Areas for improvement:

-  We learned how important it is to thoroughly plan out the models at the onset of the project.  Specifically adding a "created_date" to each would've made it so we could more easily sort posts on the index page. We can get posts to show up in reverse chronological order, but can't easily sort by # of votes.

- Key to fixing the above: We need to increase our knowledge around updating models in the middle of a project without causing "integrity errors" in the database.  This ate up a whole day in the middle of our project, and we weren't confident enough to try to change models again.


Areas that are awesome, and that we are very proud of:

- 84 Commits = we worked hard on this
- We ended up splitting up the major milestone deliverables pretty evenly
- Working management command (load_data.py)
- Django messages framework / messages work (create comments, edit post, delete post, etc)
- Login & Registration: only logged-in users can post, comment, vote.
- User can vote
- User can add and delete own posts
- User can add and delete own comments
- Comments appear with latest comment at the top
- Pagination works
- Basic, basic styling with BULMA CSS framework
- App is deployed to Heroku (Commenting is throwing an error in deployment, but works in development - we are working on this)
- We used Trello for our project management.  We didn't designate "co-author" in GitHub, but we did pair-program about 60-70% of the project together.  We both feel as if the division of duties was equitable and fair.  We communicated effectively and clearly, and we both feel really good about how we functioned as a team.
